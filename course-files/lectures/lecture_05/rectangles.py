Part 1:
In this section write two functions: 
1. get_perimeter: returns the perimeter of a rectangle,
2. get_area: returns the area of a rectangle. 
Both functions should have two required arguments: side_1: float, and side_2: float.

Part 2:
When you're done with Part 1, modify your get_perimeter and get_area functions
so that they have one required argument (side_1:float), and one optional argument 
(side_2:float) that has a default value of None. Then, if the calling funciton
only passes in one argument, assume that you're calculating  the perimeter and 
area of a square.
HINT: This code requires an "if statement," which we will be reviewing at the 
end of class today
