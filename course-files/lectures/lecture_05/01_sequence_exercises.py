# Complete the following exercises:
# 1. Write a function that prints the third element of any list or tuple.
#    Your function should take a list or tuple as an argument, but it will
#    not return anything. When your done, invoke (call) your function as follows:
#
# print_third_element(['freshman', 'sophomore', 'junior', 'senior'])
# print_third_element([12, 24, 36, 48, 60])
# print_third_element(((20, 20), (20, 40), (40, 40), (40, 20)))


# 2. Write a function that appends an element to a list.
#    Your function should take a list as an argument, and will return a 
#    list with the extra element appended. When your done, call your 
#    function as follows:
#
# print(append_element(['freshman', 'sophomore', 'junior', 'senior'], 'masters\'s student'))
# print(append_element(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 'e'))
# # use indents to help you read your code:
# print(
#     append_element(
#         [(20, 20), (20, 40), (40, 40)], 
#         (40, 20)
#     )
# )
