# In this file, you are going to practice using the following built-in functions:
# 1. pow
# 2. sum
# 3. min
# 4. max
# 5. len

# For each of them, answer the following questions:
# 1. What is the function's job?
# 2. What are the required (positional) arguments?
# 3. What are the optional (keyword) arguments?
# 4. What does the function return (if anything)?

# In addition:
# Call the function with the required inputs and print the return 
# value to the console (if there is one)


# I will do the first one for you...
